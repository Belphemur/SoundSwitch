## Features

### Recording Devices
SoundSwitch can also take care of your recording devices. You can set specifics hotkeys as for the playback devices.

### Notifications
SoundSwitch provides five types of notification when a device was changed.

- #### Banner
Uses a custom always-on-top frame, useful for in-game usage. This is the recommended default display style.

- #### Windows Notification
Uses the balloon tip of Windows. In the case of Windows 7, it's the little balloon that opens next to the systray icon. For Windows 10, it's the notification system that slides from the right corner of the screen.

- #### Sound Notification
This notification is a sound played on the switched device. This way when you are switching devices, the new device will 'chime' to tell you it's selected.

- #### Customized Sound Notification
The same as a Sound Notification but you can specify the sound which is played.

- #### Toast Notification (â‰¥Win 8)
If you are on Windows 8 or later, you can use this type of Toast Notification. More personalization is possible, by default the notification is silent, but you can set a custom sound for it (mp3 or wav for now).

If you want to return to a silent Toast Notification, open the file selector, and just do Cancel. Doing that will remove the set sound.

## Advanced

### Communications
SoundSwitch can also change the **Default Communication Device** when asked in the Settings. Windows makes a differentiation between Multimedia and Communication; it means if an application asks to have access to communications audio device, it will receive the Default Communication Device. By default SoundSwitch only changes the multimedia device and not the communication. Now if the checkbox is checked in the settings, it will also change the Communication Device.

### Auto-Updater
This is one of the interesting feature, the auto-updater. Every 24h SoundSwitch will check the GitHub repository (thanks to the GitHub API) for a new release. If a new one is available the user will get a notification and the 'No update available' in the context menu will change to 'Update Available (X.X.X)' where X.X.X represent the new version number. When the user clicks on it, a new window opens with a progress bar (see screenshots). The new version gets automatically downloaded in the temp folder of the user. When the download is finished, the user can install the Update by just clicking the install button. A changelog is also provided by getting the information set in the release on GitHub.

#### Update Modes
There are three different options available: **Silent**, means the program updates itself in the background without any prompts. **Notify**, you will be notified when there's an update available. **Never**, well this is self-explained.

### Multi-Language Support
There are five languages available: **English**, **French**, **German**, **Spanish**, **Italian** and **Portuguese(Brazil)**.
